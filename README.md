## Purpose 

The Covid impact has affected everyone all over the world in a number of different ways.Goverment restrictions
have caused leisure centres and other health centres to close for a long period of time meaning there is less 
people living healthly and being active which is an essiential part of daily life.This fictional Yoga club which 
i have based in London,offers Yoga sessions for people who are unable to leave their houses due to restrictions and 
would rather do Yoga from home so they are still able to live a more relaxed life.

I have built a fully responsive website to let my customers know of what we offer at the club and our ethos.Fitness 
Nurture wants to be the best yoga club for any Yogi's across the capital and far beyond.
