## Purpose 

The Covid impact has affected everyone all over the world in a number of different ways.Goverment restrictions
have caused leisure centres and other health centres to close for a long period of time meaning there is less 
people living healthly and being active which is an essiential part of daily life.This fictional Yoga club which 
i have based in London,offers Yoga sessions for people who are unable to leave their houses due to restrictions and 
would rather do Yoga from home so they are still able to live a more relaxed life.

I have built a fully responsive website to let my customers know of what we offer at the club and our ethos.Fitness 
Nurture wants to be the best yoga club for any Yogi's across the capital and far beyond.

# Design

## Colours 

I went with only three colours to keep a nice balane and format throughout the page.This was #3a3a3a,#add8e6 and #fff.
The grey was used for the background colour of the whole HTML file.The white colour was used for the Headings to give it 
a nice contrast.The light blue was used when hovering over the navigation bars and also on the contact form.

## Wireframes 

Fitness Nurture is a single paged website with four different navigation icons.The single page design was chosen as i felt
that there was enough content to only fill just a single page and more imagery was necessary just to describee the settings
