## Purpose 

The Covid impact has affected everyone all over the world in a number of different ways.Goverment restrictions
have caused leisure centres and other health centres to close for a long period of time meaning there is less 
people living healthly and being active which is an essiential part of daily life.This fictional Yoga club which 
i have based in London,offers Yoga sessions for people who are unable to leave their houses due to restrictions and 
would rather do Yoga from home so they are still able to live a more relaxed life.

I have built a fully responsive website to let my customers know of what we offer at the club and our ethos.Fitness 
Nurture wants to be the best yoga club for any Yogi's across the capital and far beyond.

# Design

## Colours 

I went with only three colours to keep a nice balane and format throughout the page.This was #3a3a3a,#add8e6 and #fff.
The grey was used for the background colour of the whole HTML file.The white colour was used for the Headings to give it 
a nice contrast.The light blue was used when hovering over the navigation bars and also on the contact form.

## Wireframes 

Fitness Nurture is a single paged website with four different navigation icons.The single page design was chosen as i felt
that there was enough content to only fill just a single page and more imagery was necessary to catch the users attention.

Please see the wireframes below for the varying devices:<img src= "wireframes/mobile-balsamiq.png"> <img src="wireframes/tablet-balsamiq.png"> and <img src="wireframes/desktop-balsamiq.png">


## Typography 

The fonts chosen for my project were Roboto and Mukta as i thought they  both completmented each other well and the boldness 
of the strcture catches the users mind immideatly and also helps any Visually Impreared users.For my Logo i have chosen Roboto and 
for my main headings and text i have gone with Mukta.Sans-serif has been added as a backup font in the event that the fonts do not load.


## Imagery 

The images from my website have been acquired from [RawPixel](https://www.rawpixel.com/search/yoga%20free%20images?sort=curated&page=1RawPixel)(Hero and About us images) and [YogaPedia](Yhttps://www.yogapedia.com/) (Class images section)


# Features 

## Exsisting Features 

For my  project I have gone with a single page website, Which is fully responsive and consists of a header, footer and 4 main sections; Home, Classes, About Us and Contact.

### Navigation

I have implemented a navbar wgich is fully responsive and collapses down into a hamburger menu on smaller devices. It provides a full list of links to access each of the key sections on the website.

### Hero Image 

The hero image sets the stage for The Fitness Nurture website along with the motiviational qote which i have assigned inside the image 
for the user to see as soon as they have go onto the website.This provides the user with a feel good message and something which they 
can take positively to keep scrolling down the page.

### Classes 

The classes section shows three of the different Yoga poses which we offer.They are laid side by side and when they are hovered open they
increase in size and some text is shown inside which are the meaning/instructions and benefits of the pose.This provides the user a fun 
and interactive way of finding more about some of the poses we offer.

### About us

The About us section provides the user with a background of why this Yoga club was started,Its motivitions and future goals.We stress to 
the user that we are accepting of all people and that we are a fun enviroment.I have added two images with two different text sections which
are side by side.When viewed on smaller screen devices the images and text stacked up on eachother to provide a more stuctured layout.There is also a call to action on this page which can direct the user to our contact section.

### Contact 

The contact sections consitis of two blocks one of which is the address,email and contact numbers of the Fitness Nurture yoga club.The 
other block is made up of a Form which the user can submit for any other queries they would like to find out about the club.When viewed 
on smaller screens they are stacked on top of eachother to maintain a proper layout.

### Footer 

The Footer consists of four different social media links and icons for Instagram,Facebook,Youtube and Twitter.This is where the user can find out more about our how we operate.

### Future Features 

In the future,I would like to include a newsletter option to our users which provides them insights and trends on Yoga and also indiviual
videos for different Yoga poses.
